				<p class="student">I am Bidhan Rai and i am bachlor student at Nami in partnership with the university of Northamption with
					focus in BSc.computing.my journy as an computing student is stressful but at the same time this is something that i love 
					i had always passionate about technology ever since i was in grade nine.The most attractive aspect I find of technology is problem sloving.
